## Tweakfork
Tweakfork is a fork of Masa/Maruhon's mod [Tweakeroo](https://github.com/maruohon/tweakeroo). Its basically the same thing, except with some small changes to make life a little bit easier. 

1. Multi-layer block break restriction -> can prevent you from making potholes in the ground when speedmining
2. Block break whitelist/blacklist restriction -> can prevent you from accidentally mining the wrong block and flooding your redstone
3. Toggleable flexible block placement -> may save you from arthritis
4. Stacking flexible block placement -> apply rotation to adjacent/offset placements


Tweakeroo
==============
Tweakeroo is a client-side-only Minecraft mod using LiteLoader.
